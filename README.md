Metabolome and proteome analyses reveal
transcriptional misregulation in glycolysis of
engineered E. coli


Brief to-do to achieve the main figures from the paper:

1) PAR.mat contains the 5000 parameter sets from the paper. To create them again, run create_SS_solutions.m.
2) To achieve figure 4c, run Figure.m and provide PAR.mat (is selected per default). Using parfor speeds up the analysis (it takes several hours).

If something is not working for you dont hesitate to message me.
